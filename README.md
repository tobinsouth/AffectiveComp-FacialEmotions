# Affective Computing Group Project - The Repo When GANs fail

Turns out GANs are hard. OpenCV is less hard. Here is a bunch of code to build out an emotion demo product as a backup.

Two key files currently:
- `emotion_lag.py`: is a simple script that will add your current expression to a queue and display a lagged face simulating delayed communication.
- `emotion_swap.py`: is a script that will swap your current expression with a set of pre-collected emotions provided by the user or an emoji. Designed to be an example of limited emotional expression range (or the use of a computer to show emotion).
