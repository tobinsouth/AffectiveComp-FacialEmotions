# Affective Computing Group Project - The Repo When GANs fail

Turns out GANs are hard. OpenCV is less hard. Here is a bunch of code to build out an emotion demo product as a backup.

When running `app.py` it will create a localhost server that will allow the user to input faces for future use. At the end of collection the faces will then be overlayed depending on the emotion.


Demo: Have two users self-record on their screens, then swap the screens and have them talk.
